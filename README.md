# Handwritten-Digits-Classification
### About 
- During my Summer 2018 internship at the Port of Seattle, one of the individual Machine Learning projects that I got to work on was a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Utilizing the database of handwritten digits from MNIST (60,000 training examples, 10,000 testing examples), I created and improved a CNN to recognize the digit (0-9) that a 28x28 B&W pixelated picture displays.
- In this project, I heavily utilized the Pytorch Deep Learning Framework to implement the network. Pytorch really allowed for an easy integration into understanding the structure behind a CNN.
